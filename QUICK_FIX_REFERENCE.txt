# Quick Fix Summary: Cannot Plant Bomb After Explosion

## The Bug (1 Sentence)
**`remove_bomb_from_grid()` increments the bomb counter instead of decrementing it, so after the first bomb explodes, the counter is too high and new bombs cannot be planted.**

---

## Root Cause (3 Steps)

1. **Plant Bomb:** `bomb_planted += 1` → goes from 0 to 1 ✅
2. **Explode Bomb:** `bomb_planted += 1` → goes from 1 to 2 ❌ (should be 0!)
3. **Try Plant Again:** Check `bomb_planted < bomb_limit` → `2 < 1` = FALSE ❌

---

## The Fix (1 Line)

**File:** `character.py` → `Bomb.remove_bomb_from_grid()`

```python
# OLD (WRONG):
self.GAME.PLAYER.bomb_planted += 1

# NEW (FIXED):
self.GAME.PLAYER.bomb_planted -= 1
```

**What Changed:** `+=` becomes `-=`

---

## Why It Works

- **Insert bomb:** +1 (increase counter when bomb placed)
- **Remove bomb:** -1 (decrease counter when bomb removed)
- **Result:** Counter cycles 0 → 1 → 0 → 1 correctly

---

## Test It
```
1. Plant bomb (SPACE) → Bomb appears
2. Explode bomb (LEFT CTRL) → Explosion appears
3. Plant new bomb (SPACE) → Should work now! ✅
```

**✅ Fix Applied!** The code change is in `character.py` line ~375.
