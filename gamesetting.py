# FILE: gamesetting.py - GLOBAL GAME CONFIGURATION AND CONSTANTS
# ============================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Centralized configuration file containing all game constants, settings,
#   and sprite coordinate mappings. This file serves as a single source of
#   truth for:
#   - Display settings (resolution, FPS)
#   - Game mechanics (level size, timer, enemy attributes)
#   - Color palette
#   - Sprite sheet coordinates for all game entities
#   - Score values and sound file names
#
# USAGE:
#   Import as: import gamesetting as gs
#   Access values like: gs.SCREENWIDTH, gs.FPS, gs.PLAYER, etc.
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Default window resolution - fits most laptops and monitors
SCREENWIDTH = 1280   # Window width in pixels
SCREENHEIGHT = 720   # Window height in pixels (default 720)

# Target frame rate for consistent game speed across all devices
FPS = 60  # Frames per second - controls game update frequency

# Vertical offset for positioning info panel and game world
Y_OFFSET = 92  # Pixels from top of screen where game world starts (leaves room for info panel)

# ============================================================================
# GAMEPLAY SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
# Time limit for each stage in seconds (countdown timer)

# ENEMY ATTRIBUTES - Defines behavior for each enemy type
# ============================================================================
# Dictionary mapping enemy names to their characteristics:
# - speed: Movement speed multiplier (0.5 = slow, 4 = very fast)
# - wall_hack: Can pass through soft blocks if True
